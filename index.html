                    Hello! You probably already noticed, but my name is Branford, and this is my website. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was born in Nashville, TN, where I lived until I left for Hampton U in 2012. I originally went to school as a pre-med student, but I noticed that the projects and assignments that seemed most interesting were those that involved research, writing, and generally working creatively. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, I make ends meet by completing freelance writing projects for small-business clients. I love working this way because I learn about the things that my clients need written about, and I can produce work that I'm proud of from anywhere with an internet connection. In addition to writing for others, I also write on Quora in order to both sharpen my skills and answer others' questions. My hope in doing this is to "find my voice" so to speak, and figure out what exactly my readers want to see from me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Right now, I'm learning to develop websites. I belive coding to be one of the most valuable skills of the coming years, and I intend to be in position to take advantage of the opportunity by learning to efficiently produce elegant and effective code. I aim to use the skills I'm learning to add to the services I can offer to clients, and I am open to taking on projects as I go. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I thank you for checking out my page; I'd love to hear from you!
